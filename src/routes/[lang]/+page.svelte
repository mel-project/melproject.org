    title="Decentralization <b><nobr>beyond blockchains</nobr></b>."
  >
    <p>
      Today, Web3's decentralization revolution is largely limited to blockchain
      smart contracts. Real apps running on your device &mdash; even Web3
      frontends &mdash; still suffer under Web2's regime of centralization and
      insecurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel presents a new paradigm: <b>off-chain composability</b>. Here, "Web3
      protocol" and "dApp" aren't fancy names for smart contracts loosely taped
      onto a Web2 frontend. Instead, they're next-generation network protocols
      and apps transformed by a blockchain providing radical decentralization,
      censorship resistance, and incentive-based security.
    </p>

  </TalkingPoint>

  <TalkingPoint
    title="Universal, composable, and <nobr><b>fiercely neutral</b></nobr>."

  >
    <p>
      Conventional blockchains are complex machines running an ecosystem of
      on-chain smart contracts. Complexity leads to messy governance, unwieldy
      off-chain clients, and cripple growth beyond "crypto" apps like DeFi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel's clean-slate L1 turns this model upside-down. Everything is designed
      for easy and secure access by regular, non-blockchain programs. Trustless
      clients easily power everything from naming systems to data storage
      networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And rather than adding complexity, we end up with an elegant, minimal
      blockchain that goes back to the very root of blockchains' incentive-based
      trust: an immutable, "code-is-law" system that liberates us from
      contentious human governance.

    title="The first <b>zero-trust, <nobr>low-volatility</nobr></b> currency."
    graphic={AtmImage}
  >
    <p>
      The future we are building needs a new kind of money. Neither volatile
      cryptocurrencies nor fiat-pegged, oracle-trusting stablecoins point to our
      monetary future.
    </p>
    <p>
      MEL is the first ever cryptocurrency that's both stable and trustless.
      Protocol-internal mechanisms dampen its value against computation time
      without any oracles. A truly decentralized unit of account changes
      everything from payments to incentive design.
    </p>

  </TalkingPoint>

  <TalkingPoint
    title="Off-chain composability means <b>cross-chain</b> composability."
  >
    <p>
      Mel's new paradigm and the existing ecosystem aren't inherently at odds.
      The technology letting non-blockchain logic securely access blockchain
      data also enables cross-chain apps that are completely decentralized and
      trustless.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an official demo, we are building FancyName, an autonomous relay
      protocol with EVM-compatible chains. Every Mel-based asset can be accessed
      on other chains in a trustlessly wrapped form. This also means that wMEL
      will be the first low-volatility, truly crypto-native asset in the current
      DeFi ecosystem.
